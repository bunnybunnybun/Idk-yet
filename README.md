# Idk-yet
Idk-yet (I can't for the life of me come up with a good name...) is a desktop environment for Linux. A desktop environment, is basicaly what makes different operating systems *look* different from each other. Think, the taskbar, settings menu, etc of an operating system. Basicaly all the main GUI elements.

THIS IS STILL IN A VERY EARLY STATE, and most functionality that you would expect from a desktop environment simply does not exist yet.

## Demo video:

## Notable features:
 - An app launcher :P
 - A wallpaper selector, that uses a custom backend that allows for interactive/parallax wallpapers.
 - A taskbar :)

## In progress/Coming soon (hopefully):
 - A settings app
 - A screenshot utility
 - An introduction menu
 - A utility for making custom interactive wallpapers

## Installation:
Note: If you are reviewing this for Siege (that's probably why you are here) you don't need to install it, just watch the demo video linked above.
Note 2: this currently only works on Arch Linux (and probably its derivitives like Manjaro or CachyOS)
First do ```git clone https://github.com/bunnybunnybun/Idk-yet```
Then run ```./Idk-yet/Idk-yet/install_script.sh```
Then your done! Everything will be setup automaticaly, just reboot.
