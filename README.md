# Idk-yet
Idk-yet (I can't for the life of me come up with a good name...) is a desktop environment for Linux. A desktop environment, is basicaly what makes different operating systems *look* different from each other. Think, the taskbar, settings menu, etc of an operating system. Basicaly all the main GUI elements.

Currently this is in a very early state, but my hope is to make this into a nice user friendly system, potentially even expand it to a full Linux distro.
