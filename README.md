# Idk-yet
Idk yet is a "shell" for Linux. A shell, in this context, is referring to the taskbar, settings menu, etc of an operating system. Basicaly all the main GUI elements.

Currently this is in a very early state, but my hope is to make this into a nice user friendly system, potentially even expand it to a full Linux distro.
